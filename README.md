A basic threaded particle engine for use in Cinder - WIP. The goal is to have a versatile, and fast, particle engine that can be used most place without issue.

Please looks at the sample as to how to adjust the different parameters.

* HEADS UP: The app will take a second or two to close as I need to allow enough time for threads to properly close before exit.
